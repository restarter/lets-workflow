# Task Note

Add a note to the active beads task. For mid-work documentation - progress updates, research findings, decisions, context for future sessions.

**This is a utility, not a flow step.** Main flow handles documentation automatically:
- `/lets:commit` records commits to the task
- `/lets:done` documents task completion
- `/lets:end` saves session progress

Use `/lets:note` when you want to add extra context that doesn't fit those flows.

## When to Use

- Research findings: "Investigated X, found Y"
- Design decisions: "Chose approach A because..."
- Blocker discovered: "Can't proceed until Z"
- Context dump: "Important info for next session"

## Step 1: Active Task Detection

Use the **detect-task** skill to find the active task (read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/detect-task/SKILL.md` and follow its detection flow).
If no active task or multiple tasks found - ask user which task to add a note to.

## Step 2: Review Current State

```bash
bd show <task-id>
bd comments list <task-id>
```

Check existing comments to avoid duplicating info.

## Step 3: Ask What to Note

If not obvious from conversation context, use **AskUserQuestion**:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions=[{
    question: "What kind of note?",
    header: "LETS",
    options: [
      { label: "Progress", description: "What's done and what remains" },
      { label: "Decision", description: "Record a choice and reasoning" },
      { label: "Research", description: "Findings and recommendations" },
      { label: "Blocker", description: "What's blocking and possible solutions" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
)
```

**Other** (free text) -> use as note content directly, infer type.

## Step 4: Add Note

```bash
bd comments add <task-id> "## {Note type} {YYYY-MM-DD}

{content based on type}"
```

### Note Templates

**Progress:**
```markdown
## Progress {date}

### Done
- {what was completed}

### Remaining
- {what's left to do}
```

**Decision:**
```markdown
## Decision {date}

**Chose:** {option}
**Over:** {alternatives}
**Because:** {reasoning}
```

**Research:**
```markdown
## Research {date}

### Findings
- {key discoveries}

### Recommendation
- {suggested approach}
```

**Blocker:**
```markdown
## Blocker {date}

**Issue:** {what's blocking}
**Impact:** {what can't proceed}
**Options:** {possible solutions}
```

## Step 5: Record Scope Change (if needed)

If the task scope or understanding changed significantly, record it as a comment (never overwrite the description):

```bash
bd comments add <task-id> "[scope-change] <what changed and why>"
```

## Step 6: Verify

```bash
bd show <task-id>
```

## Output

```
Note added to **{task title}** ({task-id})

┌─ LETS ─────────────────────────┐
│  Check?   /lets:check          │
│  Commit?  /lets:commit         │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Rules

- **Be specific** - "Fixed bug" is useless, "Fixed null check in PaymentService.process()" is useful
- **Record decisions** - future you will thank you
- **Use markdown** - comments support formatting
- Respond in user's language
